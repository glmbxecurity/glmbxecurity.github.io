I'm Edward Herrera Galamba. I studied Systems Engineering and Administration and currently work as IT Chief and Systems Manager in the Spanish Army, focusing on Cybersecurity analysis, threat mitigation, Active Directory, virtualization, and network administration.  
  
My military background has taught me discipline and structured problem-solving, which I apply to my work and my passion for cybersecurity. I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in ethical hacking labs and CTF challenges, and continuously improving my skills by developing projects that solve common problems within my organization and enhance efficiency and security.
